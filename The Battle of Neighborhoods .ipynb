Both classes have never travelled out of Nigeria and they wished to know the kind of venues and places that are available in the city of Melbourne. \n\n### For the unskilled people, this will help them know what kind of skills they might need to immediately acquire to help them secure jobs immediately, when they eventually get there. For the business class, knowing that environment will let know and prepare for the kind of business opportunities they can leverage on when they eventually move over there.",
